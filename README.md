I used 7 functions in this project. These are resetBoard, printBoard, checkFreeSpaces, PlayerMove, opponentMove, checkWinner, printWinner.
resetBoard function is for reseting the board by filling it with empty spaces.
printBoard function is for printing the board to the console.
checkFreeSpaces function is for cehcking the number of empty spaces on the board and returns.
playerMove function is for we takes a move from the player and checks whether it is a valid move. If it is a valid move, it places it on the board.
oppenentMove function is for allowing the computer to make a random move.
checkWinner function is for controlling a game-winning situation. It checks horizontal, vertical and diagonbal triples and returns its symbol if there is a winner.
printWinner function is for printing the winner or draw status on the screen.
