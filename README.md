Date: 03.08.2024  

This game is xox . You are playing against the computer. I used 7 functions in this project. These are resetBoard, printBoard, checkFreeSpaces, playerMove, opponentMove, checkWinner, printWinner.


## Planning

### 1. resetBoard Function
- Firstly, resetBoard function is for reseting the board by filling it with empty spaces.

### 2.  printBoard Function
- printBoard function is for printing the board to the console. 

### 3. checkFreeSpaces Function
- checkFreeSpaces function is for cehcking the number of empty spaces on the board and returns. At first this number is 9 because the number of spaces on the board is 9. 

### 4. playerMove Function
- Another function, playerMove function is for we takes a move from the player and checks whether it is a valid move. If it is a valid move, it places it on the board.

### 5. opponentMove Function
- oppenentMove function is for allowing the computer to make a random move. It chooses random positions until it finds an empty space and places the move on the board. In other words, it is not programmed to win, but it should be remembered that it can also win.

### 6. checkWinner Function
- checkWinner function is for controlling a game-winning situation. It checks horizontal, vertical and diagonbal triples and returns its symbol if there is a winner.

### 7. printWinner Function
- The last function, printWinner function is for printing the winner or draw status on the screen.
